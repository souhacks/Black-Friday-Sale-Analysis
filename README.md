# Black-Friday-Sale-Analysis
This dataset comprises of sales transactions captured at a retail store. It's a classic dataset to explore and expand your feature engineering skills and day to day understanding from multiple shopping experiences. This is a machine learning problem.
In this project, we are going to predict how much the customers will spend during Black Friday, using various features such as age, gender, marital status. The dataset we are going to use is the Black Friday dataset from Kaggle which contains about 550068 rows and 12 features that can be downloaded here. We will follow all the steps of a Data Science lifecycle from data collection to model deployment.
